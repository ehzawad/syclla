## choose the right word
### scold, berate, chile, revile, upbraid, vituperate
> A mother might **scold** a child who misbehaves, which means to rebuke in an angry, irritated, and often naggin way, whether or not such treatment is justified.

> **Chide** is a more formal term that scold, and it usually implies disapproval for sepecific failings (*she was chided by her teacher for using "less" instead of "fewer"), while **berate* suggests a prolonged scolding, usually aimed at a pattern of behavior or way of life rather than a single misdeed and often combined with scorn or contempt for the person being criticized (*Efat berated his parents for being too protective and ruining his social life*).

> **upbraid* also implies a lengthy expression of displeasure or criticism, but usually with more justification than scold and with an eye toward encouraging better behavior in the future (*the tennis coach upbraided her players for missing so many serves*).

> **Revile** and **vituperate** are reserved for very strong or even violent displays of anger. To *revile* is to use highly abusive and contemptuous language (*revile one's opponent in the press*), while *vituperate* connotes even more violence in the attack (*the angry  hockey players were held apart by their teammates, but they continued to vituperates each other with the foulest possible language*).

## choose the right word
### shake, quake, quiver, shiver, shudder, tremble
> Does a cool breeze make you **shiver**, **quiver**, **shudder**, or **tremble**? All of these verbs describe vibrating  wavering,or oscillating movements that, in living creatures, are often involuntary expressions of strain or discomfort.

> **Shake**, which refers to abrupt forward-and-backward, side-to-side, or up-and-down movements, is different from others in that it can be done to a person or object as well as by a person or object (*shake visibly while lifting a heavy load; shake a can of paint*).

> **Tremble** applies specifically to the sight and rapid shaking motion the human body makes when it is nervous, frightened, or uneasy (*his hands trembles when he picked up the phone*).

> To **shiver** is to make a similar movement with the entire body, but the cause is usually cold or fear (*shiver in the draft from an open door*)

> **Quiver** suggests a rapid and almost imperceptible vibration resulting from distributed or irreular surface tension; it refers more often to things (*the leaves quivered in the breeze*), although people may quiver when they're under emotional tension (Novera's lower lip quivered and her eyes were downcast*).

> **Shudder** suggests a more intense shaking, usually in response to something horrible or revolting (*shudder at the thought of eating uncooked meat*).

> **Quake** implies a violent upheaval or shaking, similar to what occurs during an earthquake (Avik's heart quaked at his father's approach*).

##### back -> *to give support to someone or something*
> The management has refused to back our proposals.

> This theory needs to be backed up with solid empirical evidence.

First there will be a "teaser preview" in which the ideas are briefly hinted at; then a "headline" in which each idea is examined somewhat more closely; next a clear, detailed parahraph or more will analyze the idea in all its ramifications; finally the dword itself, which you meet only after you are completely familiar with the idea.

#### Squirm factor in USS Callister in "Black Mirror"

> Though it's funny throughout, this episode does involve some deeply uncomfortable scences. Robert's leering, vaguely sexual dominance over his female crew memners is hard to stomach. So is his casual propensity for torture, and his blackmail tactics, which include child murder. But the undercurrent of self0awareness helps soften the discomfort, and the episode takes a fairly light look at some serious issues with the clever, outrageous subplot involving Nanette threatening revenge porn again her real-world self.

### cruelty, brutality
In his essay "Notes on the English Character," E. M. Forster casually observes that brutality is considered a German trait and cruelty a Spanish one, just as superficiality is thought to be an American trait and hypocrisy a British one. I understand well enough superficiality and hypocrisy. But I would dearly love to know what Forster thought the difference was between _**brutality**_ and _**cruelty**_. Let us say that either word implies the inflicting of pain. Is _**brutality**_ akin to ruthlessness, the inflicting of pain as the most effective means to achieve stipulated ends? And is _**cruelty**_ related to sadism, where the viciousness is done fot its own sake and not for an imagined advantage?
